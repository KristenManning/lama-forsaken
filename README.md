## The Problem 

In the United States, job applicants are protected under federal law from discrimination based on race, national origin, gender, pregnancy, age, disability, or religion. These laws go so far as to bar employers from inquring about these topics during an interview. But, in practice, most of this information is readily available on the applicant's resume or LinkedIn page, or becomes apparent during an interview. In the worst case, employers can intentionally discriminate based on almost any factor simply by Googling the applicant's name, but in the far more common and perhaps more detrimental case, employers have access to far too much information during the hiring process, and make decisions based on unconcious biases. 

## The Solution 

We aim to bring diversity into the workplace by bringing anonymity into the hiring process. Our app allows applicants to break free from the typical resume or LinkedIn page template and describe their skills however they choose, using their own discretion to omit details that may reveal personal information. Applicant profiles do not feature a name, headshot, or contact information  -- employers will only learn an applicant's full identity after scheduling an interview. In advance of this first interview offer, employers chat with the applicants, ask for work samples, and send them skills assessments. This format front-loads the hiring process with a meaningful exchange of anonymous information, and delays the more subjective, bias-prone interview process. 

## The Market 

#### Job Seeker Statistics 
A 2015 survey Pew Research Center found that 79% of Americans who'd looked for work in the two years prior to the study used the internet in their job search, and more than a third cited it as "the most important resource," outranking friends, family, professional connections, and job fairs. Currently, LinkedIn has over 476 millioon members worldwide. 

#### Blind Hiring & Workplace Diversity Statistics
- A 2003 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that when identical resumes were paired with either avery White sounding name or a very African American sounding name, the White sounding name led to 50 percent more interview offers. 
- 9% of computer science graduates from the top 25 programs, but only 5% of employees at top tech companies, are African American, Latino, or Native American. This trend appears in law as well, with 16% of law school graduates, but only 8% of newly hired associates, coming from underrepresented minorities. 
- In 2015, there were more C.E.O.s named David than there were C.E.O.s who were women.
